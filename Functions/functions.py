# Description:
# This program will, given input, take the goldback decomposition, tell you the
# greatest common divisor of two numbers, tell you if the number is perfect, 
# tell you the prime factors, and show you nice menu altogether. Trust me,
# this assignment is the most outlandish that I have ever seen. 
# Have fun though and please, enter integers only or i will throw a 
# nasty but generic error message at you. Cheers!
