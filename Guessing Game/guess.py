# Description:
# This program is a game.
# You will need to guess the contents of a word
# file and subsequently play with another user.
# Guessing wrong has no penalty, but if it already
# exists, you lose a point.

# welcome() displays the welcome 
# Input:  none
# Output: welcome statement to welcome the user to the game.

# Input:  none
# Output: getInput, the filename.
